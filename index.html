    The Multi User Domain project is an early-development open-source platform for creating Multi User Domains.
    Building on semantic web standards users <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">store their own data</a>, taking their characters and items with them as they travel between different "worlds"; servers created by a community to store shared physical world, like towns and places.
</p>
<p>
    The semantic web is open by design, making it highly extensible. There is a lot of fun to be had in the building of a world, even without any "text-based adventure", simply by creating a village, coming back in 6 months to find that your village is now a city, or that the bartender at the saloon you visited last week is complaining about another player who came in and challenged them to a duel.
    Your world server doesn't have to define what a duel is, what a saloon is or what a memory is, it just needs to allow players and machines to write to it in RDF.
    It doesn't have to redefine how to describe what's happening because this concern has been separated to the content server providers.
</p>
<!--<p>
    If you don't know what the semantic web, or what RDF is, then <a href="">this blog post</a> is a good place to start. If you do understand RDF data but you want to know about the project's origins and what it means in the application of game design, then read that post too :-)
</p>-->
<p>
    The project is in early development but we want people to get involved. To understand more please start at the <a href="{{ 'docs/01-overview' | relative_url }}">high-level overview</a> to see how it works. <!--Afterwards, if we've piqued your interest, then please <a href="">get in touch</a>.-->

    The MUD is open-source and currently made up of the following sub-projects:
</p>

<h2>The Vocabularies</h2>
<p>
    The vocularies are OWL/RDF documents served in Turtle format to describe all of the data models being used to build the world, content and logic in the MUD.
    All in draft status and so subject to a high degree of change for the time being
</p>

</p>

<h2>React - The Client</h2>
<p>
    Currently this repository defines all of the React extensions for helping to interface with the MUD vocabularies and for building a client-side app to interface with MUD servers. It also implements a specific client for interfacing with them, which when the repository is more mature will be separated from this repository (<a href="https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/mud-react/issues/2">https://github.com/Multi-User-Domain/mud-react/issues/2</a>).

<h2>Java & Apache Jena - The Server(s)</h2>
<p>
    The repository for all things World Server, Content Server and Action Server.
